# 9.1.001 & 9.0.56
* UNITY_VERTEX_OUTPUT_STEREO was accidentally put in the appdata struct causing compilation problems in some cases
* Added decal alpha blend modes
* Fixed a bug with color adjust gradation in nonvrc color screenspace
* Flat shading generates a shadow map behind the scenes so hide in shadow functions corectly. You can no disable this if you want

Don't know how to fix
decal depth uv0 only (uses tangents which are generated from uv0)

post 9.0
* Add udon video texture
* Use Luminance for Min Brightness when using Realistic Lighting
* use depth to move skirt out of leg geometry
* matcap spritesheet
* truchet thickness audio link
* outline grabpass with pixelation
* internal parallax no global mask
* internal parallax no way to use it as emission and it shows in the dark by default
* LTCGI
* fur
* add a no special uv toggle to decals
* scrolling emission offset by uv x or y
* UV glitching for textures
* screenspace ao in base pass
* plane uv better pano effects including fresnel effects and depth
* Paralax write to depth
* normal shadows https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/filamented/-/blob/master/Filamented/SharedNormalShadowLib.hlsl?ref_type=heads
* take a look at the gem cloth aniso
